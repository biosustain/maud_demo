# QMCM Kinetics workshop 2021

Welcome to our demo! 

To get started, go to
[maud-workshop.biosustain.dtu.dk](maud-workshop.biosustain.dtu.dk) and log in
with the credentials offered by the workshop organisers.

Next you will need to open a terminal by clicking `New` and then `terminal`,
then run the following command to copy a folder from the read-only `shared`
directory to the writeable `work` directory:

```sh
cp -r shared/maud_demo work
```

Finally, open the notebook by returning to the original tab, then clicking
`shared`, then `maud_demo` then `demo.ipynb`.


If you would like to install Maud on your computer, you can do so using the
instructions in the file installation.org.
